# OTP_Verification
OTP verification is a project that aims to provide a secure and convenient way of authenticating users online. OTP stands for one-time password, which is a randomly generated code that is sent to the userâ€™s phone and expires after a short period of time. This Project describes a method of generating fixed length of random generated numbers and sending it to the phone number for verification using Twilio and Tkinter libraries in Python. 
Twilio is used to generate and send a random 4-digit number as an OTP to the verified recipient's number. If the OTP is correct, a "Login Success!" message is displayed; otherwise, a wrong OTP message is shown. It has checkOTP and resendOTP methods which work to check the user's input and resend a new OTP, respectively.GUI design describe the design of the graphical user interface (GUI), which includes a canvas with a grey background, a title, an entry field, and two buttons.
